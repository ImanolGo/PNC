PNC Financial Services Group is creating a new kind of building: The Tower at PNC Plaza.
PNC has engaged ESI Design to communicate the Tower’s unique nature and to promote sustained participation in its success.

DESIGN APPROACH
The Tower generates tremendous information, particularly about the environment.
It is an inexhaustible resource that allows PNC to optimize the Tower’s interdependent systems, improve the building’s efficiency, and reduce waste.
This process will improve over time as the building and its occupants make better decisions by learning from experience.

PHYSICAL INTERFACE
The dynamic Physical Interface to the Tower at PNC Plaza is an iconic data installation featured in the Lobby.
It uses information from the Tower to create stunning patterns and dramatic visualizations of the building’s environmental performance.
ESI proposes using environmentally-conscious, energy-efficient technologies for the installation in keeping with the spirit of the Tower.
